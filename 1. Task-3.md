#### NOTE:

According to the subnet mask of the machine `255.255.255.0`, the equivalent CIDR notation is `/24`, which actually means the the IP range will be from `10.10.130.1` to `10.10.130.254`

### **2. Performing Ping Scan**

- **Objective**: Identifying active hosts within the target IP range.
- **Command used**: `nmap -sn [target IP range]`

**Snippet:**

Parent:          ()
NetType:        IANA Special Use

- **Snippet 2 (dig)**:
![[dig.svg]]

- **Result:** (Screenshot)

![[screenshot_2025-02-01_15-02-36.png]]



- **Snippet 3: (nslookup)**:
![[nslookup.svg]]
- **Result:**

	 I attempted a reverse DNS lookup using `nslookup` to check if there were any PTR records associated with the IP `10.10.130.149`. A PTR record maps an IP address to a domain name, which can help identify the associated domain or host.
        - **Command Used:** `nslookup 10.10.130.149`
        - **Outcome:** The result returned an error: "server can't find 149.130.10.10.in-addr.arpa: NXDOMAIN." This indicates that no reverse DNS (PTR) record exists for the IP, suggesting that the target machine does not have a publicly available or configured reverse DNS entry.

- **Analysis:**
    
    - The lack of results from  `nslookup` suggests that the target is likely within a private network or behind a firewall that does not expose DNS records publicly.

    - It’s possible that the target is an internal machine or a service used within a controlled environment, and as such, it may not have public-facing DNS entries. This is common for penetration testing targets, where machines in private IP ranges (e.g., `10.10.130.149`) are used for vulnerability assessments without any external-facing metadata.

### **8. Performing Vulnerability Assessment**

- **Objective:** Perform vulnerability assessment using Nmap.
- **Command Used:** `nmap --script=vuln [target IP]`

- **Snippet:**
![[vuln.svg]]

- **Results:**
    - **HTTP Cookie Flags (PHPSESSID)**:
	    - The session cookie (`PHPSESSID`) does not have the `HttpOnly` flag set. This means the session cookie could potentially be accessed through client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript), making it more vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
	
	- **Web Application Enumeration (http-enum)**:
        - Several potentially interesting directories were found:
        - `/login.php`: This might have possible admin folder.
        - `/robots.txt`: Robots file, which might reveal information about pages or directories that should be hidden from search engines.
        - `/config/`: A potentially sensitive directory with listing enabled. This could provide access to configuration files that might contain sensitive information.
        - `/docs/`: A potentially interesting directory with listing enabled, which might provide insight into the web application's documentation or other resources.
        - `/external/`: Another directory with listing enabled. This might contain external resources or additional files related to the application.

	- **Other Vulnerabilities:**
	    -  **No DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities** were found.
	    - **No CSRF vulnerabilities** were identified.
	    - **No stored XSS vulnerabilities** were identified.

### **9.Comparison with Other Tools**

### **1. Masscan for Port Scanning**:

- **Snippet:**
![[masscan.svg]]
- **Comparison**: Masscan is faster than nmap but offers less detailed results. It’s useful for large-scale scans but doesn’t identify service versions or provide vulnerability details.

- **Output**:

![[screenshot_2025-02-01_18-34-34.png]]

#### Persistent Network Configuration Warnings

While performing the `masscan` scan on the target IP range, the virtual machine consistently displayed warnings about the potential dangers of using the `ethernet0` interface. Despite changing the network adapter settings from **Bridged** to **NAT**, the warning persisted. The message seemed to suggest that the scan could lead to network instability or security concerns, possibly due to the nature of `masscan`'s high-speed scanning techniques.

#### Troubleshooting Attempts:

- **Network Adapter Change**: I  switched the adapter from **Bridged** to **NAT** to mitigate any direct connection risks. However, the warning remained unchanged.
- **Scan Rate Limiting**: I attempted to adjust the scan rate in `masscan` with the `--rate` flag to reduce the volume of packets sent, but the warning persisted.

#### Potential Causes:

- **VM Resource Limits**: The VM environment may not have sufficient resources to handle mass-scale scans without triggering security or performance warnings.
- **Firewall and Security Software**: There may be additional firewall or security software on the VM or network that detected the scan behavior, causing the alert to appear.

### **2. Nikto for Web Vulnerability Scanning**:

- **Command**:
![[nikto.svg]]


**Comparison**: Nikto focuses on web vulnerabilities and is great for finding issues like outdated software or misconfigurations on web servers. It provides more focused results compared to nmap’s general scanning.

**Example Output**:

![[screenshot_2025-02-01_19-25-43.png]]

- The nikto tool's output is similar to Nmap's output with script. 
- Something that Nmap didn't find but Nikto found was that the site doesn't have anti-clickjacking header, which might make it vulnerable to clickjacking.
- Both found out that the session cookie (`PHPSESSID`) does not have the `HttpOnly` flag set.

- **Analysis**: Performs a TCP connect scan to identify open ports.
- **Output:**

![[screenshot_2025-02-01_19-44-41.png]]


1. **UDP Scan**:
    - **Snippet:**
    ![[udp.svg]]
    
    - **Analysis**: Identifies open UDP ports on the target.
    - **Output:**
    ![[screenshot_2025-02-01_20-34-07.png]]
    
2. **Aggressive Scan**:
    - **Snippet:**
    ![[aggressive.svg]]
    - **Analysis**: Runs a comprehensive scan, identifying OS, services, and scripts.
    - **Output:**
    ![[screenshot_2025-02-01_20-18-38.png]]


3. **Stealth Scan**:
    
    - **Snippet:**
    ![[stealth.svg]]
    
    - **Analysis**: Performs a stealth SYN scan, often less detectable.
    - **Output:**
